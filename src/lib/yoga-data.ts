Poses like Cat-Cow can help with back pain, while Child's Pose offers a moment of restorative calm. Always listen to your body and avoid any deep twists or pressure on your abdomen.

Many women find the second trimester brings renewed energy. This is a great time to build strength to support your changing body. Poses like Warrior II can build leg and hip strength, while gentle hip openers like Bound Angle Pose can help prepare your body for labor.

Comfort is key in the third trimester. Focus on poses that create space and relieve pressure. Gentle side stretches can alleviate rib pain, and supported poses using pillows or blocks, like a supported Reclining Bound Angle Pose, can be incredibly relaxing. Pelvic tilts can also help with lower back pain and prepare the pelvis for birth.

Your breath is one of the most powerful tools you have for labor. Practicing different breathing techniques (pranayama) during pregnancy can help you prepare. Techniques like 'Ujjayi' (Victorious Breath) can be calming, while deep belly breathing helps to oxygenate your body and your baby. Practicing these can help you develop a rhythm to turn to during contractions.

A gentle morning routine can help you start your day feeling refreshed and energized. Begin with simple stretches in bed, then move to a seated position for gentle spinal twists. Sun Salutations can be modified for pregnancy - skip the jumping and deep forward folds. Focus on slow, mindful movements and deep breathing. This routine can also help reduce morning sickness by gently awakening your digestive system.

Strong pelvic floor muscles are crucial during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum recovery. Kegel exercises can be done anywhere, anytime. Practice contracting and releasing your pelvic floor muscles in sets of 10, holding each contraction for 5-10 seconds. Bridge pose and gentle squats can also help strengthen these muscles. Remember to breathe normally during these exercises and avoid holding your breath. Strong pelvic floor muscles can help prevent incontinence and support your baby during labor.

Partner yoga during pregnancy can strengthen your bond and provide physical support. Gentle back-to-back breathing helps you synchronize your breath and find calm together. Supported standing poses allow your partner to help you maintain balance as your center of gravity shifts. Gentle massage and stretching with your partner can relieve tension and create intimate moments of connection. Remember to communicate openly about comfort levels and always prioritize safety for both you and your baby.
