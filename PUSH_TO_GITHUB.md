# ðŸš€ Push Blooms Journey to GitHub

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `blooms-journey`
3. **Description**: `A comprehensive pregnancy and parenting companion app`
4. **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
5. **Important**: DO NOT check "Add a README file", "Add .gitignore", or "Choose a license" (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blooms-journey.git

# Set the main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

1. Go to your new repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blooms-journey`
2. You should see all your files including:
   - README.md with Blooms Journey description
   - All source code files
   - .gitignore file

## ðŸŽ‰ Done!

Your Blooms Journey pregnancy and parenting app is now live on GitHub!
