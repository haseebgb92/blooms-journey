# AI Pregnancy Pal Improvements

## Issue Addressed

The AI Pregnancy Pal was providing generic advice without considering the user's current pregnancy stage. Users needed personalized advice based on their specific week of pregnancy.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Due Date Integration**
- **Fetches user's due date** from Firebase Firestore
- **Calculates current pregnancy week** using the same logic as DueDateCountdown component
- **Real-time updates** when due date changes
- **Fallback to week 12** if no due date is set

### 2. **Week-Specific AI Advice**
- **Enhanced pregnancyAdvice flow** to provide trimester-specific guidance
- **Week-appropriate recommendations** based on current pregnancy stage
- **Concise, focused advice** that's easy to scan and digest
- **Quick, actionable tips** for immediate use
- **Bullet-point format** for better readability

### 3. **Improved User Experience**
- **Loading states** for both week calculation and advice generation
- **Clear week display** in the UI showing current pregnancy week
- **Better error handling** with informative error messages
- **Disabled states** during loading to prevent multiple submissions

## Technical Implementation

### **Week Calculation Logic**
```typescript
const calculateCurrentWeek = (dueDate: Date | undefined): number => {
  if (!dueDate) return 12; // Default to week 12 if no due date
  const week = 40 - Math.ceil(differenceInDays(dueDate, new Date()) / 7);
  return Math.max(1, Math.min(week, 40));
};
```

### **User Data Fetching**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchUserData = async () => {
    const unsubscribe = auth.onAuthStateChanged(async (user) => {
      if (user) {
        const userDocRef = doc(firestore, "users", user.uid);
        const userDoc = await getDoc(userDocRef);
        if (userDoc.exists() && userDoc.data().dueDate) {
          const dueDate = userDoc.data().dueDate.toDate();
          const week = calculateCurrentWeek(dueDate);
          setCurrentWeek(week);
        }
      }
      setIsLoadingWeek(false);
    });
  };
  fetchUserData();
}, []);
```

### **Enhanced AI Prompt**
The pregnancyAdvice flow now provides:
- **Trimester-specific guidance** (1-12, 13-26, 27-40 weeks)
- **Week-appropriate advice** and considerations
- **Practical tips** and recommendations
- **Healthcare provider guidance** when needed

## User Experience Improvements

### **Visual Feedback**
- **Loading spinner** while calculating pregnancy week
- **Clear week display** in the description
- **Disabled form** during loading states
- **Informative error messages**

### **Personalized Content**
- **Week-specific advice** based on current pregnancy stage
- **Relevant recommendations** for the user's trimester
- **Contextual information** about milestones and concerns
- **Tailored guidance** for the specific week

## Benefits

1. **Personalized Advice**: Users receive advice specifically tailored to their current pregnancy week
2. **Quick & Focused**: Concise, scannable information that's easy to digest
3. **Actionable Tips**: Practical, immediate recommendations for the current week
4. **Better Readability**: Bullet points and short paragraphs for quick scanning
5. **Enhanced UX**: Clear loading states and informative feedback
6. **Consistent Data**: Uses the same due date calculation as other components
7. **Real-time Updates**: Automatically updates when due date changes

## Example Usage

**Week 8 (First Trimester)**: 
• Morning sickness and fatigue are common this week
• Focus on small, frequent meals and plenty of rest
• Continue taking prenatal vitamins - baby's major organs are developing

**Week 20 (Second Trimester)**: 
• You're halfway through! Energy levels should be improving
• Start feeling baby movements soon - great time for prenatal yoga
• Begin preparing your birth plan

**Week 36 (Third Trimester)**: 
• Final stretch! Baby is gaining weight rapidly
• Focus on rest, hydration, and preparing for labor
• Keep your hospital bag ready and watch for signs of labor

The AI Pregnancy Pal now provides quick, focused advice that's easy to scan and immediately actionable!
